# ## Introduction
#
# We are going to use the ATLAS Open Data for this demonstration, in particular a $H\rightarrow ZZ^\star$ analysis. Find more information on the [ATLAS Open Data documentation](http://opendata.atlas.cern/release/2020/documentation/physics/FL2.html) and in [ATL-OREACH-PUB-2020-001](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2707171). The datasets used are [10.7483/OPENDATA.ATLAS.2Y1T.TLGL](http://doi.org/10.7483/OPENDATA.ATLAS.2Y1T.TLGL). The material in this notebook is based on the [ATLAS Open Data notebooks](https://github.com/atlas-outreach-data-tools/notebooks-collection-opendata), a [PyHEP 2021 ServiceX demo](https://github.com/gordonwatts/pyhep-2021-SX-OpenDataDemo), and [Storm Lin's adoption](https://github.com/stormsomething/CoffeaHZZAnalysis) of this analysis.
#
# This notebook is meant as a **technical demonstration**. In particular, the systematic uncertainties defined are purely to demonstrate technical aspects of realistic workflows, and are not meant to be meaningful physically. The fit performed to data consequently also only demonstrate technical aspects. If you are interested about the physics of $H\rightarrow ZZ^\star$, check out for example the actual ATLAS cross-section measurement: [Eur. Phys. J. C 80 (2020) 942](https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/PAPERS/HIGG-2018-29/).
#
# This notebook implements most of the analysis pipeline shown in the following picture, using the tools also mentioned there:
# ![ecosystem visualization](utils/ecosystem.png)

# %% [markdown]
# ### Tools and packages used in this example
#
# The notebook showcases:
# - data delivery with `ServiceX`
# - event / column selection with `func_adl`
# - data handling with `awkward-array`
# - histogram production with `coffea`
# - histogram handling with `hist`
# - visualization with `mplhep`, `hist` & `matplotlib`
# - ROOT file handling with `uproot`
# - statistical model construction with `cabinetry`
# - statistical inference with `pyhf`

# %% [markdown]
# ### High-level strategy
#
# We will define which files to process, set up a query with `func_adl` to extract data provided by `ServiceX`, and use `coffea` to construct histograms.
# Those histograms will be saved with `uproot`, and then assembled into a statistical model with `cabinetry`.
# Following that, we perform statistical inference with `pyhf`.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Required setup for this notebook
#
# If you are running on coffea-casa, you should be good to go: ServiceX credentials are automatically available to you.
# If not, you will need to set those up.
# Create a file `servicex.yaml` in your home directory, or the place this notebook is located in.
#
# See this [talk by KyungEon](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1076231/contributions/4560404/) for more information.

# ## Files to process
#
# To get started, we define which files are going to be processed in this notebook.
# We also set some information for histogramming that will be used subsequently.

# ## Final remarks: control flow and duplication of information
#
# In the demonstration today we first built histograms, making sure we produce all that we will need for our statistical model.
# We then built the model, saying where to find each histogram.
# If we want to add a new histogram-based systematic uncertainty, we will need to implement it in two places:
# - in the histogram-producing code (e.g. coffea processor),
# - in the model building instructions.
#
# It can be convenient to avoid this duplication, which can be achieved as follows:
# - specify all relevant information in the model building configuration,
# - use that information to steer the histogram production.
#
# This method is available in `cabinetry`, check out the [cabinetry tutorials repository](https://github.com/cabinetry/cabinetry-tutorials) to see it in action.
# With this approach `cabinetry` builds the histograms it needs itself.
#
# This works well for some cases, but not for others:
# - a simple cut can be specified easily in the configuration, and varied for systematic uncertainties,
# - a complex calculation cannot easily be captured in such a way.
#
# The image below describes different options.
# The general considerations here are independent of the exact tools used, and should apply equally when using similar workflows.
#
# ![schematic for control flow options](utils/control_flow.png)
#
# A flexible design that works well for all scenarios is needed here, but is not available yet.
# If you have thoughts about this, please do get in touch!

# Here are a few ideas to try out to become more familiar with the tools shown in this notebook:
#
# - Run the notebook a second time. It should be faster now — you are taking advantage of caching!
# - Change the event pre-selection in the `func_adl` query. Try out requiring exactly zero jets. Has the analysis become more or less sensitive after this change?
# - Change the lepton requirements. What happens when only accepting events with 4 electrons or 4 muons?
# - Try a different binning. Note how you still benefit from caching in the `ServiceX`-delivered data!
# - Compare the pre- and post-fit data/MC agreement (hint: the `fit_results` kwarg in `cabinetry.model_utils.prediction` is optional).
# - Find the value of the `Signal_norm` normalization factor for which CL_S = 0.05, the 95% confidence level upper parameter limit (hint: use `pyhf` directly, or `cabinetry.fit.limit`).
# - Separate the $Z$ and $t\bar{t}$ backgrounds and add a 6% normalization uncertainty for $t\bar{t}$ in the fit.
# - Replace the 10% normalization uncertainty for the $ZZ^\star$ background by a free-floating normalization factor in the fit.
#
#
# Advanced ideas:
# - Implement a more realistic systematic uncertainty in the `coffea` processor, for example for detector-related uncertainties for lepton kinematics. Propagate it through the analysis chain to observe the impact in a ranking plot produced with `cabinetry`.
# - Try out this workflow with your own analysis! Are there missing features or ways to streamline the experience? If so, please let us know!
